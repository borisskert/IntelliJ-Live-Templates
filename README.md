# My IDEA IntelliJ Live-Templates

## Installation

Copy the files (or git clone this repo) to directory `<configuration_directory>/templates`.

The value `<configuration_directory>` depends on the IntelliJ-version and operating system. See [IntelliJ documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/tuning-the-ide.html#config-directory) for further information.

For example on Linux and IntelliJ 2019.3 you can find your configuration at `~/.IntelliJIdea2019.3/config`.
In a MacOS environment you will find your configuration at `~/Library/Preferences/IdeaIC2019.3/templates`.

To keep this configuration up-to-date you can clone this git-repo into the configuration directory.
